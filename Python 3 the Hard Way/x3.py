#PEMDAS = Paranthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
"""That’s the order Python follows as well. The mistake people make with PEMDAS is
to think this is a strict order, as in “Do P, then E, then M, then D, then A,
then S.” The actual order is you do the multiplication and division (M&D) in one
step, from left to right, then you do the addition and subtraction in one step
from left to right. So, you could rewrite PEMDAS as PE(M&D)(A&S)."""
