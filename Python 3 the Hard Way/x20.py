QUESTION:
Why does seek(0) not set the current_line to 0?
First, the seek() function is dealing in bytes, not lines.
The code seek(0) moves the file to the 0 byte (first byte) in the file.

Why are there empty lines between the lines in the file?
The readline() function returns the \n thatâ€™s in the file at the end of that
